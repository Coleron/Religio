 <h2>What the Data displays</h2>

 The Census claims that the spread of the Christian Population is around NSW, however the rate of income <br>
 is balanced by showing that the majority of earnings are moderate in the suburban areas. <br>
 For a better understanding a 3-D NSW map of the "Expanded Christian Map" is available in the tab. 
  <p>
  <br><br>
 
  <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
 
 <p>Studies claim that Christianity is the largest religion in Australia being 52.1% of the whole population. <br>
 This explains why they are spread out and not concentrated in certain parts in NSW suburbs.<br> <br>
  
  The Christian Brothers arrived in schools during the 1800’s because of influence and age of the religion <br>
  being spread across NSW in due time, it proposed a new faith.<br> 
 <p>
  <br><br>
  
 <h2>Conclusion of the old faith</h2>
 <p> 
 The lattel line is non existant for the Christian income earners. Their income <br>
  is stable because of their numbers being the highest worshiped religion in Australia <br>
  meaning Christians occupy over 50% of jobs. This is due because the spread of <br>
  early Christianity has been spreading in the early 1800’s around Australia’s land. <br>
  The foundations of their beliefs are to been seen with compassion and influence. <br>
