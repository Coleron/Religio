 Mesh blocks are analysed among the smallest geographical area for the Australian <br> 
 Bureau Statistics SA1 census data. The SA1 is a small Australian statistical mainframe <br> 
 which breaks up the region into smaller data collection in comparison to SA2 – SA3 etc. which holds a higher amount.<br><br>
 
 After the year 1961 the Australian Census takes place every 5 years. The latest census collected was in 2016 <br><br>
 
 Data journalism reflects upon the numerical data set used for distributing information. <br>

<h2>The 2016 Christian income earners in NSW suburbs</h2>
 <p>
 The data which has been analysed through the ABS demonstrates the population of the Christian income.<br>
The concentrated areas represent the amount of Christians in the area as shown in the legend. <br><br>

While being the dominant faith in the country, focusing on the big religion should visualise a standard <br>
  of achievement for the average person. The distribution of income expansion in the suburbs should identify <br>
  a latte line in the Christian earners life however it is not apparent. The spreading of the faith <br>
  displays a wide balance in the Christian wage. <br>

 <h2>What the Data displays</h2>
 <p>
 The Census claims that the spread of the Christian Population is around NSW, however the rate of income <br>
 is balanced by showing that the majority of earnings are moderate in the suburban areas. <br>
 For a better understanding a 3-D NSW map of the "Expanded Christian Map" is available in the tab. 
  <p>
  <br><br>
 
  <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
 
 <p>Studies claim that Christianity is the largest religion in Australia being 52.1% of the whole population. <br>
 This explains why they are spread out and not concentrated in certain parts in NSW suburbs.<br> <br>
  
  The Christian Brothers arrived in schools during the 1800’s because of influence and age of the religion <br>
  being spread across NSW in due time, it proposed a new faith.<br> 
 <p>
  <br><br>
  
 <h2>Conclusion of the old faith</h2>
 <p> 
 The lattel line is non existant for the Christian income earners. Their income <br>
  is stable because of their numbers being the highest worshiped religion in Australia <br>
  meaning Christians occupy over 50% of jobs. This is due because the spread of <br>
  early Christianity has been spreading in the early 1800’s around Australia’s land. <br>
  The foundations of their beliefs are to been seen with compassion and influence. <br>
